# multi-system-dashboard

This system enables data to be retrieved from REST apis and displayed in a way that has improved readability for the user.

The use of graphs and 'widget' based data grouping provides a simple and effective solution to user's struggling to understand large quantities of data. 

The system has been created to be generic enough to intergrate with most api's that return JSON data. By creating systems, endpoints and then widgets, dashboards can be created to suit any API.
